			<p><b>ARIZONA -- It's a testament to how mentally incompetent -- and frankly, imbecilic -- cops can be.</b></p>
			<p>In the video you're about to see, Terri Franklin, a long-time dog owner can be heard standing her ground against a cop named Officer Whipple (real last name) who literally announced that her pet dog was under arrest.</p>

			<p>One can only imagine what Office Whipple was planning to do to this innocent animal.</p>

			<p>Was the cop thinking he would slam the dog to the ground and place handcuffs over the animal's frail wrist bones, then take mug shots of the dog back at the station?</p>
			
			<p>Or was he planning to intimidate the dog in order to justify shooting it dead?</p>

			<p>Fortunately, neither of those scenarios panned out, since the Terri Franklin asserted her rights and remained strong throughout the ordeal.</p>

			<p>The incident started when Terri had to run an errand, and secured her dog in her vehicle.</p>

			<p>When people passed by her car in the parking lot, the pet would bark at them through the window — presumably wanting to get out and play, or perhaps just defending the vehicle.</p>

			<p>When Terri heard the barking, she came back to her vehicle and apologized to the people whom her dog barked at, and explained that her dog was usually a very friendly animal but was probably just thinking it had to protect its family.</p>

			<p>The dog never attacked anybody, and everybody was prepared to go their separate ways without incident.</p>

			<p>But by the time Terri could leave, an officer arrived at the scene and began an attempt to escalate the situation.</p>

			<p>Evidently, a “good obedient citizen” had called the police when the dog was barking, thinking it best that the power of the State could be used to solve an otherwise mundane situation with violence.</p>

			<p>Although everybody else had understood Terri’s apology and left by this time, the cop decided that punishment would have to be meted out.</p>
