<p>PASCO, Wash. - A police officer involved in a deadly shooting in Washington state was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city of Pasco settled in 2013 for $100,000. The Seattle Times reports the lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations, according to court records. Residents of the town where police shot and killed a man accused of hurling rocks at officers are calling for calm ahead of an anti-police brutality protest scheduled for noon Saturday. The death Tuesday of orchard worker Antonio Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco, an agricultural city of 68,000 people about 215 miles southeast of Seattle</p>
