		<p>The focus of the Peaceful Streets Project is to promote
		greater police accountability, but it's not limited to law enforcement. The 1<sup>st</sup>
		amendment of the US Constitution protects our right to collect, document,
		record and disseminate information of public interest. This is paramount to
		seeking redress of grievances perpetrated by government officials.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately not every public official is interested in
		protecting individual rights, and many will blatantly violate the rights of
		those who seek to document official misconduct. In order to protect against such
		blatant violations, it's important to plan ahead and take steps to preserve one's
		photos and videos. One of the best ways to accomplish this is via the use of
		cloud storage services.<br>
		<br>
		When considering cloud storage for government accountability, there are two
		general schemes to consider; quality or the safety of your data. We use both.
		(These assume use of a smart phone for photos and video.)</p>

		<p>The quality and resolution of the cameras in any smart phone sold after 2010 are
		sufficient to capture high definition photos and video, and exceed the quality
		of most popular streaming apps. When paired with the backup application of many
		cloud storage accounts such as <a href="https://db.tt/BhGd4CZT">Dropbox</a> or <a
		href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/">Onedrive</a>, a quality copy can be preserved.
		But these applications don't begin uploading until recording is stopped.
		Uploads can still continue in the background, with the screen asleep and
		hopefully locked. But that upload won't survive the destruction of the
		smartphone if it's seized.</p>

		<p>Alternatively one can choose one of the many available live streaming applications such as <a
		href="http://qik.com/">Qik</a>, <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">Ustream</a>,
		or our favorite, <a href="http://bambuser.com/">Bambuser</a>. The quality of
		video, even with a strong signal, isn't as high as using the phone's native
		camera, and often special features such as low-light handling aren't available.
		But since video is uploaded live, and archived, there is nothing to be
		confiscated or destroyed. <a href="http://bambuser.com/">Bambuser</a> allows
		one to turn off the screen, lock the phone, and continue recording; a unique
		feature.</p>

	     <span>The Services</span>
         </header>

		<p>The cloud services discussed below are only a small portion
		of the available options, and include those our volunteers have evaluated.</p>

		<p><a href="https://db.tt/BhGd4CZT">Dropbox</a>: Though not the
		first to offer cloud storage, Dropbox took an early lead and is now a household
		name. Free accounts begin with 2GB. Extra storage, up to 16GB, can be earned
		via referrals and other special offers. Paired with desktop applications,
		uploads are synced with any linked PC's.</p>

		<p><a href="https://copy.com/?r=UJ719G">Copy</a>: A later
		arrival to the cloud, Copy starts new users with 25GB and an additional 5GB for
		new referrals. However the larger capacity comes with a web portal that is clunky
		compared to Dropbox's web interface. There is also a limitation on file size
		uploads unless one uses either the smartphone or desktop application. It does
		make a good companion to Dropbox.</p>

		<p><a href="https://app.box.com/login">Box</a>: Box offers new
		users 10GB. It has offered referral programs in the past and extra space via
		other special offers, but extra space for free accounts is currently limited to
		installs of smartphone and desktop applications. It also restricts single files
		to 250MB.</p>

		<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?invref=5269c0ee93249c29&amp;invsrc=90">Onedrive: </a>Onedrive is Microsoft's
		rebranded Skydrive. Initially offering 15GB, additional storage can be earned
		via referrals and the smartphone's “camera roll” feature, which is the
		auto-upload we're interested in, affords an extra 15GB. With occasional offers
		of additional storage such as the recent 100GB offer for 2 years via bing
		rewards, and other loyalty bonuses, Onedrive is one to watch.</p>

		<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>: Starts
		out new users with 15GB. And while it doesn't offer any referral options or
		other methods to earn extra storage, it does allow file sizes up to 10GB, and
		integrates well into all of Google's services.</p>

		<p>Other cloud services include: <a href="https://www.bitcasa.com/">Bitcasa</a>, <a href="https://my.pcloud.com/#page=register&amp;invite=ys2XZvj6mLy">pCloud</a>
		and many others. A good comparison can be found <a href="http://www.cloudwards.net/comparison/">here</a>.</p>

		<p>In addition to having reliable cloud syncing options, it's
		important to consider secure offsite back once you get home with your video.</p>

		<p><a href="https://spideroak.com/download/referral/f166965c0c429ed66d74498363175d60">Spideroak</a>,
		<a href="https://tresorit.com/download?mode=1&amp;ref=3coQrg">Tresorit</a>:
		Spideroak and Tresorit offer less storage to free accounts than other services,
		and don't have options to upload from one's smartphone. But unlike other
		services, offer superior protection. Spideroak's coined "zero-knowledge
		protection" encrypts data with 2048 bit RSA and 256 bit AES prior to uploading.
		Even if compelled to produce data via judicial order, only encrypted data is
		available. Tresorit's ongoing hacker challenge, coupled with a similar
		encryption scheme offer strong confidence in their protection. Spideroak offers
		2GB to start, and Tresorit offers 6GB. Both have referral programs available to
		earn additional encrypted storage.</p>

		<p><a href="https://mega.co.nz/">Mega</a>: Mega Is the
		reincarnation of Megaupload. They offer 50GB for free accounts, 2048 bit
		encryption and a very solid web portal to upload, manage and share files. Mega also offers apps for 
		android, IOS and new clients for Mac and Windows. We
		highly recommend it for supplementary offsite storage.</p>

		<p><a href="https://degoo.com/g/OOyuDda">Degoo</a>: Degoo is a
		new service currently in beta that is based on the concept of distributed
		storage. Offering up to 100GB of free storage, Degoo stores files in the unused
		free or slack space of user's drives in encrypted blocks. A more detailed explanation
		can be found <a href="http://support.degoo.com/customer/portal/articles/1428478-how-safe-is-degoo-">here</a>.
		Currently we are testing it as a proof of concept, updates will be available as
		the service develops.</p>

		<p>As mentioned, these services are only a small portion of the
		current offerings in cloud storage. Anyone wishing to submit reviews will be
		considered for inclusion. More information about how to safely record and assert one's rights can be found our <a href="flex.html">Flex</a> page.</p>
