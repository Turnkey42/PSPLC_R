<p>Homeland Security cops detained a man for video recording outside a National Security Agency building in Texas, telling him it was illegal to record the building, even though it is clearly visible from the side of a busy street.</p>
		<p>It started with one Homeland Security officer pulling up in his vehicle, stepping out and demanding to know what he was recording and insisting on seeing his identification.</p>
		<p>But the man, who only provided his first name as Carlos, refused to provide his identification on the basis that there was no probable cause to detain him.</p>
		<p>But the Homeland Security cop persisted.</p>
		<p>"If you're surveilling a government facility, yes, I have a right to detain you, yes, I can ask you for your identification, and yes, you are going to provide that to me," he said.</p>
		<p>And yes, he was proven wrong.</p>
		<p>Within three minutes into the video, the Homeland Security cop, who at that point was joined by a San Antonio cop demanding identification, had no choice but to let him go.</p>
		<p>The man then asked for the officer's name and badge number, telling him there was a law that required him to provide that information.</p>
		<p>However, that is a common misconception. There is no law that states officers must provide identification, at least not federally or in Texas.</p>
		<p>But most law enforcement agencies have policies that require officers to identify themselves by name and badge number when asked, a policy that is commonly violated.</p>
