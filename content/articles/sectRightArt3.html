		<p>In the last few months, the citizens of Washington State have come under fire from both state and federal officials.  They have been subject to everything from surveillance to being viewed through the scope of a sniper's rifle--manned by a fellow citizen.  The people have appealed to the governor to no avail.  According to Governor Inslee's office, he has no jurisdiction over the federal authorities who seek to subvert liberty and control the populace.  He is incorrect, but the People accept that he is complicit in the criminal enslavement of the citizens.<br><br>
		The governor was served a list of grievances by We the People on 7 February 2015.  Each of those grievances constitutes a crime against the People, and against the founding documents of the state and our nation.  He ignored those grievances and did nothing.  On 25 February 2015 a citizen of Washington State was illegally arrested, detained, and interrogated as a domestic terrorist by federal officials who ignored his rights secured by the rule of law.  The governor refused to stand and serve the citizens of his state as he swore to do, instead submitting himself and the people of this state as subjects to an overreaching federal government.  On 9 March 2015, he was again called to task and the People demanded that he uphold his oath to protect and maintain the rights of the People as secured by the Constitution.  Again, the governor chose to ignore this letter and in doing so, ignored the will of the People, and their unalienable rights.<br><br>
		It is for this reason that the people of Washington State now appeal to the sheriffs, as the senior law enforcement official in each county.  When the system fails, it becomes their utmost duty to stand and uphold the law.  It is obvious that the system of  Constitutional law has failed; at every turn we see the blatant and gross violation of the most basic of the People's rights.  The government is bound by the Constitution to be accountable to the People; they derive their powers from the consent of the governed.  We, the people of Washington State, reiterate our withdrawal of this consent in light of the government's refusal to honor the limits to their power and the unlimited rights of the People.<br><br>
		Washington State law lays out the <a href="http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.28.010" target="_blank"> general duties of the county sheriff:</a></p>
