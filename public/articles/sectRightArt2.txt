<p>	ARIZONA -- It's a testament to how mentally incompetent -- and frankly, imbecilic -- cops can be.<br><br>
			In the video you're about to see, Terri Franklin, a long-time dog owner can be heard standing her ground against a cop named Officer Whipple (real last name) who literally announced that her pet dog was under arrest.<br><br>

			One can only imagine what Office Whipple was planning to do to this innocent animal.<br><br>

			Was the cop thinking he would slam the dog to the ground and place handcuffs over the animal's frail wrist bones, then take mug shots of the dog back at the station?</p>
