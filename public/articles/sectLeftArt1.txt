<p>From the start of this judicial fiasco, Pierce County prosecutors have objected to 3rd party video documenting these courtroom proceedings and have made half-hearted attempts to appeal to the judge to restrict recording in the courtroom, in violation of the 1st amendment and article 1, section 10 of the <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/LawsAndAgencyRules/Pages/constitution.aspx" target="_blank">Washington State Consitution.</a><br><br>

In our above stylized nazi-esque trailer of the 2/23/2015 hearing, Pierce County Prosecutor Saadatzadeh Pejman falsely cites a previously unmentioned case, Wa State v. Njunge to support his motion to suppress video recording of the proceedings. Not only does the case he cited have no mention of video recording, it was sent back on appeal for improper closing of the courtroom. Thanks for that tip, we'd never have found the <a href="http://leg.wa.gov/Senate/Committees/LAW/Documents/RightToAPublicTrial.pdf" target="_blank">Bone Club Rules</a> otherwise. Yet Judge Carla Buttdorff, ruled in his favor without batting an eye.<br><br>

During the latest readiness hearing, Pejman predictably renews his request. (video upcoming). The silence from the prosecutor's desk and the bench are palpable when objections to the veracity of the objection are made, as are the chuckles from the gallery and observing attorneys. It was also interesting to note that the usual cadre of 4-6 deputies were missing from this hearing. We do grant that Judge Carla Buttdorff finally made a wise choice as she ordered the prosecution to make any further motions in writing; something he's neglected to provide in this case.

Subsequent research in this case led us to discover that this is not the first time Pierce County Deputy Dennis Robinson #417, has run afoul of his temper, having assaulted another disabled man during an <a href="http://www.thenewstribune.com/2015/03/10/3678987_tacoma-man-contends-deputies-mistreated.html" target="_blank">incident on Feb. 7, 2013. </a>It seems Pierce County has more to worry about than a few video cameras. However it does explain their reluctance to comply with public records requests. What else do they have to hide?
